# argocd-applicationset-demo

### Purpose

This repository contains slides, Kubernetes manifest files and instructions for my talk *Deploy N Applications to N Clusters using Argo CD ApplicationSet*. This is not a stand-alone workshop repository. You will need to refer to the talk slides/video to make sense of the exercises provided below. The resource section contains suggested readings/resources on GitOps, Argo CD and ApplicationSet.

### Pre-requisites

- An understanding of Kubernetes, GitOps and Argo CD
- Access to at least two managed Kubernetes clusters (recent versions preferred). For ease of reference, we'll call the cluster where Argo CD is installed `cluster-manager` and the other cluster(s) as `managed-cluster`. 
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) & [argocd](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/cli_installation/) CLI tools installed  (recent versions required)
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) for easy Kubernetes cluster context switching (optional)

### Argo CD and ApplicationSet installation

```
kubectl create namespace argocd

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/v0.2.0/manifests/install.yaml
```

### Accessing the Argo CD API Server

1. Change the argocd-server service type to _LoadBalancer_

```
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

2. Wait a few minutes for the loadbalancer to be available:

```
kubectl get svc -A | grep argocd-server
```

Right next to the private IP column, you will see a public IP for the `argocd-server` service.

3. From a web browser, navigate to that public IP. Use `admin` as the username and find the default password from the following command (Argo CD v1.9 and later):

```
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

4. Change the default admin password for Argo CD server from the CLI:

```
argocd login <public IP found in step2>
```

Use the same credentials from Step3.

Once succesfully logged in, use the following command to update the password:

```
argocd account update-password --current-password <default admin password> --new-password <set a password of your choice>
```

:construction: For the following examples, make sure that the namespace already exists on the cluster(s) prior to creating the Application/ApplicationSet custom resource(s).

### Argo CD Demo

```
kubectl create namespace kustomize-nginx-ns

kubectl apply -f files/kustomize-nginx-app.yaml -n argocd
```

---

### ApplicationSet Demo

**List Generator example**:

```
# Change the Kubernetes context first
kubectx <context for the managed-cluster>

# Create the namespace on the managed-cluster
kubectl create namespace guestbook-ns

```

```
kubectl apply -f files/list-generator.yaml -n argocd
```

**Git Generator (directory) example**:

```
kubectl apply -f files/git-generator-directory.yaml -n argocd
```

:construction: guestbook-jsonnet application will take longer to sync and appear healthy. 


**Matrix Generator (list & git directory) example**:

```
kubectl apply -f files/matrix-generator.yaml -n argocd
```

### FAQ

1. What permissions does Argo CD need in the remote managed cluster?

--> `argocd cluster add <context>` command creates:
- serviceaccount named **argocd-manager** in kube-system
- clusterrole named **argocd-manager-role**
- clusterrolebinding named **argocd-manager-role-binding**

2. How is Flux CD similar or different from Argo CD?

--> [This](https://luktom.net/en/e1683-argocd-vs-flux) article does an excellent job at answeing the same question.

3. How is Tekton or Argo Workflow different from Argo CD?

--> Tekton and Argo Workflow provide ways to declare workflow pipelines for execution on Kubernetes. Tekton focuses on source based workflows, while Argo Workflow is more general purpose.

Argo CD is specifically built to address application delivery/deployment on Kubernetes following GitOps principles. That's why, it offers more sophistication and powerful features which cannot be expected from tools like Tekton or Argo Workflow. 

4. How do you handle dev work when you're testing manifests in a namespace? Do you keep creating PRs or temporarily disable the sync?

--> You can disable *auto-sync* under the Sync Policy but there is no concept of disabling sync. For dev work, I'll assume that you're using your own feature branch and also deploying to a dev cluster. In that case, it shouldn't matter if you play around as you can specify your own feature branch for the git repo and you won't need to create PRs (i.e. the webhook event will react to every push on your feature branch).

5. Can we measure the latency of the self-healing functionality for Argo CD?

--> I don't think it's possible from a user-end but there is a retry option that can be configured per Argo CD application. Refer to *syncPolicy* --> *retry* [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/application.yaml). 

6. When do we use different generators like the *Matrix Generator*?

--> In this demo, the *list-generator* example deploys from a single repository to multiple clusters and the *git-generator-directory* example deploys from a monorepo to a single cluster. If you were to deploy from a monorepo to multiple clusters, you can use *Matrix Generator* and use both *list-generator* and *git-generator-directory* together. This is just an example as you can mix and match other generators together. 

6. What happens when an ApplicationSet is deleted?

--> When an ApplicationSet is deleted, the following occurs (in rough order):

- The ApplicationSet resource itself is deleted
- Any Application resources that were created from this ApplicationSet (as identified by owner reference)
- Any deployed resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc) on the managed cluster, that were created from that Application resource (by Argo CD), will be deleted.
    - Argo CD is responsible for handling this deletion, via the deletion finalizer.
    - To preserve deployed resources, set .syncPolicy.preserveResourcesOnDeletion to true in the ApplicationSet.

Thus the lifecycle of the ApplicationSet, the Application, and the Application's resources, are equivalent.
